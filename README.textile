h1. Rails3 + Mongoid + Devise

This is an example *Rails 3 application* that combines *Devise* with *Mongoid*. The "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise gem gives you ready-made authentication and user management. MongoDB is used as a datastore with the "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org/  gem for quick development without schemas or migrations.
